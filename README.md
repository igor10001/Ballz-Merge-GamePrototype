# Ballz + Merge

## Overview

**Ballz + Merge** is a hybrid game that combines mechanics from the popular "Ballz" game and merge gameplay. The player shoots balls at numbered cubes positioned on a grid. When a ball hits a cube, the cube's health decreases, and it moves in the direction of the ball's impact. If two cubes with the same number collide, they either merge or both take damage, depending on their remaining health.

## Current Status

The game is still in development and is not yet complete. Key mechanics are implemented, but there are features that need polishing and additional functionality that would enhance the gameplay experience.

## Contribute

If you have the time and skills, your contributions are welcome ( i'm too busy now )! There are several areas where the game could be improved:

- **Gameplay Mechanics:**  Finish the mechanics of predicting the trajectory

- **UI/UX Design:** Enhancing the user interface and user experience.
